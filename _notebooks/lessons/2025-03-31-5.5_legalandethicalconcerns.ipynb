    "# Legal & Ethical Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes on the Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intellectual Property (IP)\n",
    "**Definition:** Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, including inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce. It grants creators exclusive rights to their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Digital Impact on IP:\n",
    "- Digitization makes sharing, copying, and distributing content easier.\n",
    "- Increased accessibility raises concerns about ownership and unauthorized use.\n",
    "- Businesses and individuals must protect digital assets from unauthorized replication or misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Copyright Protection:\n",
    "- Safeguards original works such as books, music, films, and digital content.\n",
    "- Prevents unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution.\n",
    "- Copyright is automatic upon creation; registration provides legal advantages.\n",
    "- Infringement may lead to fines or legal action.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Forms of IP Protection:\n",
    "- **Patents:** Protect inventions by granting exclusive rights.\n",
    "- **Trademarks:** Safeguard brand names, logos, and slogans.\n",
    "- **Trade Secrets:** Cover confidential business information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enforcing IP Rights:\n",
    "- Legal measures like licensing agreements and digital rights management (DRM) help control usage.\n",
    "- Companies must monitor and enforce rights to prevent infringement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Licensing a Repository\n",
    "**What is a Software License?**\n",
    "A legal agreement defining how others can use, modify, and share code. Without a license, \"All Rights Reserved\" applies, meaning nobody else can use the code legally.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Licensing Matters:\n",
    "- Protects work while allowing controlled use.\n",
    "- Encourages open-source collaboration with clear rules.\n",
    "- Prevents legal issues when using or sharing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open Source & Open Access\n",
    "- **Open-Source Software (OSS):** Publicly available software that anyone can use, modify, and distribute.\n",
    "- **Open Access Code:** Online research with minimal use restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "- Encourages collaboration and contributions.\n",
    "- Open access research removes access barriers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Open-source projects can be misused for harmful purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open-Source Licenses\n",
    "| License         | Permissions                                       | Restrictions                                    | Common Uses                 |\n",
    "|---------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|\n",
    "| MIT          | Free to use, modify, distribute with credit | No liability/warranty         | Web apps, libraries, frameworks |\n",
    "| Apache 2.0   | Similar to MIT, includes patent protection | Must include license notice    | Large-scale projects, APIs    |\n",
    "| GPL          | Free to use, modifications must be open-source | No private versions            | Software meant to stay open-source |\n",
    "| BSD 3-Clause | Modify and share freely, even in closed-source projects | No warranty                    | Academic projects, software  |\n",
    "| Creative Commons | Defines reuse permissions (rare for code) | Not for software, mostly docs/images | Documentation, art, books |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Legal Violations\n",
    "| Action | Reasoning | License Violated |\n",
    "|--------|----------|-----------------|\n",
    "| Using code without a license | Default is \"All Rights Reserved\" | Any repo without a license |\n",
    "| Modifying & distributing GPL code without releasing changes | GPL requires derivative works to be open-source | GPL |\n",
    "| Removing a required license notice | Some licenses require keeping copyright notice | MIT, Apache, GPL |\n",
    "| Selling open-source software without permission | Must follow license terms | GPL, Apache 2.0, CC |\n",
    "| Using code with a Non-Commercial (NC) license for profit | Some licenses prohibit commercial use | Creative Commons NC |\n",
    "| Copying proprietary software without payment | Paid licenses required | All proprietary software |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethical Concerns\n",
    "- **Respect for IP:** Unauthorized code usage disrespects creators' rights.\n",
    "- **Developer Trust Violation:** Open-source relies on community trust.\n",
    "- **Unfair Advantage:** Using unlicensed code creates unfair competition.\n",
    "- **Lack of Attribution:** Not crediting original authors is plagiarism.\n",
    "- **Commercial Exploitation:** Profiting from work without following license terms is unethical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Case: Google vs. Oracle\n",
    "Oracle claimed Google copied APIs, while Google argued fair use due to licensing and API rules.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Hacks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popcorn Hacks 1\n",
    "1. **What is a legal concern when sharing/using code?**\n",
    "   - Unauthorized usage or infringement of intellectual property rights.\n",
    "2. **What is an ethical concern when sharing/using code?**\n",
    "   - Failing to give credit to original developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popcorn Hacks 2\n",
    "**Scenario:** You're building an open-source lyric-guessing app. You want it to spread fast, but also prevent big corporations from stealing your work. Which license do you pick?\n",
    "- **MIT:** Easiest to access but allows corporations to take without restrictions.\n",
    "- **GPL:** Forces modifications to remain open-source, preventing corporate misuse.\n",
    "- **Apache 2.0:** Adds patent protections, making legal disputes easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homework\n",
    "1. **Add a license to your repo** (or change an existing one) and explain your choice.\n",
    "   - Steps:\n",
    "     - Go to GitHub repo → \"Add file\" → \"Create new file\".\n",
    "     - Name it `LICENSE`.\n",
    "     - Click \"Choose a license template\" and select one.\n",
    "     - Commit the file.\n",
    "     #### COMPLETED\n",
