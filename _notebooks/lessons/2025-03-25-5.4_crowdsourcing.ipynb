    "\n",
    "**Key Aspects:**\n",
    "- Reduces *computer bias* through varied perspectives\n",
    "- Enables *shared knowledge* and *resources*\n",
    "- Uses *distributed computing* across locations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Crowdsourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Crowdfunding\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Raise money from many small contributors\n",
    "- **Examples:** Kickstarter, GoFundMe\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Startup launching new product\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Crowd Creation\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Collaborative content generation\n",
    "- **Examples:** Wikipedia, Threadless\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Company sourcing logo designs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Crowd Voting\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Collective decision-making\n",
    "- **Examples:** Reddit upvotes, talent show voting\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Choosing product features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Crowd Wisdom\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Aggregate knowledge\n",
