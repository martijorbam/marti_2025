    "\n",
    "Graphs are a fundamental data structure in computer science used to model relationships between objects.  \n",
    "Each object is a **node (vertex)**, and the connection between them is an **edge (arc)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In a **complete graph**, there is a single edge between every pair of distinct vertices.\n",
    "- There are **no loops** and **no multiple edges** in such graphs.\n",

    "## üìç Common Uses of Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Google Maps, GPS)\n",
    "- Web page ranking (e.g., Google‚Äôs PageRank algorithm)\n",
