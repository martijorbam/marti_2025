    "# ðŸŽ“ My 2024â€“2025 Coding Journey: Projects, Growth, and Showcasing Success\n",
    "\n",
    "As the school year comes to a close, Iâ€™m proud to reflect on a year filled with learning, problem-solving, and personal growth in computer science. Through each homework assignment and team collaboration, Iâ€™ve built more than just code â€” Iâ€™ve built confidence, curiosity, and the foundation for future innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸš€ Overview of Projects: What I Built and Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the year, Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of technical projects â€” each with its own goals, challenges, and breakthroughs. Here are some highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optivize**: I developed a one-page business platform with features like AI chat support, inventory management, product success prediction, and a smart calendar.\n",
    "- **StudyBuddy**: Built a note-taking feature, allowing shared access and real-time editing. This project deepened my understanding of backend communication and user interaction design.\n",
    "- **Cookie Sales Predictor**: I implemented machine learning to forecast cookie sales based on user input â€” one of my first real-world data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can explore all my homework blogs and tech write-ups [here](https://martijorbam.github.io/marti_2025/search/).\n",

    "## ðŸ§  A Year of Lessons: Growth Beyond the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This year wasnâ€™t just about mastering syntax. Iâ€™ve learned to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debug with confidence** and treat failure as part of the creative process.\n",
    "- **Collaborate in teams** using Agile principles and Git/GitHub.\n",
    "- **Present my work clearly**, whether in blogs, demos, or live showcases.\n",
    "- **Use tools like SQLite, Flask** to build full-stack web apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every homework submission became a building block toward a bigger goal. This year taught me not just how to code â€” but how to *think like a developer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŒŸ Showcasing My Work: N@tM and Beyond\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most exciting moments this year was **N@tM (Night at the Museum) - June 2025**. I showcased my team's project to families, students, and community leaders. I demonstrated the features of Optivize and got real-time feedback from visitors who were impressed by the AI integration and business focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Iâ€™ve kept a detailed blog throughout the year to document and reflect on my technical journey. My blog is more than a portfolio â€” itâ€™s a certification of the hard work and growth Iâ€™ve achieved this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’¡ What Makes My Work Unique?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **I connect code to real impact.** Whether helping local businesses or building educational tools, I code with purpose.\n",
    "- **I lead with structure.** As a Scrum Master, I organize teams, manage timelines, and ensure everyone contributes their best.\n",
    "- **I write clean and thoughtful reflections** to track my journey and help others learn from my experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Looking Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "The lessons and projects from this year are just the beginning. Iâ€™m excited to keep building, learning, and sharing what I create. Whether through future internships, open-source contributions, or launching new ideas, Iâ€™m ready to take everything Iâ€™ve learned to the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks for following along with my journey.\n",
