    "## Quote Manager \n",
    "The Quote Manager feature allows users to store, edit, and delete quotes in a database. It provides a user-friendly interface with a dynamic table displaying quotes, authors, and dates. Every row in the datatable includes a quote with its respective author and date.\n",
    "The backend API handles all interactions using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, ensuring seamless data management. \n",

    "Sends a GET request to the API_URL endpoint to fetch all quotes.\n",
    "Awaits the API response, which returns a JSON object containing an array of quote records. The data is transferred with JSON using jsonify(), which converts Python objects like dictionaries or lists into a JSON-formatted response that the frontend can easily process. ðŸš€\n",

    "### User Actions\n",
    "There is a table that allows the user the input a quote, author and date. The POST method allows it to add a new row to the database with the data that the user added. \n",
    "The database also has edit and delete options. \n",
    "#### Edit (PUT)\n",
    "When the edit button is clicked, the user inputs new data for the quote, author, or date and the PUT method allows him to change the contents in the database without adding a new row. First, it extracts the updated quote details from the request. Then, it alidates input and ensures the quote exists. After that, it updates the database and commits the changes. Finally, it returns a JSON response confirming success or an appropriate error message.\n",

    "#### DELETE\n",
    "The delete button uses the DELETE method to delete a specific quote and the whole row by its ID and returns a success or error message in JSON format.\n",
