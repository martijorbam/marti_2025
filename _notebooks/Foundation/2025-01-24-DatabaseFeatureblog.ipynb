    "## Quote Manager \n",
    "The Quote Manager feature allows users to store, edit, and delete quotes in a database. It provides a user-friendly interface with a dynamic table displaying quotes, authors, and dates. Every row in the datatable includes a quote with its respective author and date.\n",
    "The backend API handles all interactions using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, ensuring seamless data management. \n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/dbfeaturess.PNG\" alt=\"GET\" class=\"pic\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript Methods in the Quote Management App\n",
    "\n",
    "This script manages user quotes through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a REST API.  \n",
    "Data is sent and received in **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `fetchQuotes()`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Fetches and displays quotes from the API.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Sends a `GET` request to `API_URL`.\n",
    "  - Parses the **JSON** response containing an array of quotes.\n",
    "  - Iterates through the quotes and dynamically updates the HTML table.\n",
    "  - Each row includes an \"Edit\" and \"Delete\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `addQuote(event)`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Adds a new quote to the database.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Prevents form default submission with `event.preventDefault()`.\n",
    "  - Reads input values (author, quote, date).\n",
    "  - Converts data into a **JSON object** and sends a `POST` request.\n",
    "  - If successful, the new quote is added, and the form is reset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `deleteQuote(id)`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Deletes a quote based on its ID.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Sends a `DELETE` request to remove the quote.\n",
    "  - If successful, the user is alerted, and `fetchQuotes()` refreshes the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. `editQuote(id, currentAuthor, currentQuote, currentDate)`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Prepares the form to edit an existing quote.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Switches from \"Add\" mode to \"Edit\" mode.\n",
    "  - Pre-fills the form fields with the current quote's data.\n",
    "  - Overrides form submission to send an updated **JSON object** via a `PUT` request.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. `cancelEdit()`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Cancels the edit mode and returns to the add form.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Hides the edit form and shows the add form.\n",
    "  - Resets the edit form fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. `init()`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Initializes the app on page load.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Attaches the `addQuote()` function to the form’s submit event.\n",
    "  - Calls `fetchQuotes()` to load existing quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. `DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener\n",
    "- Ensures `init()` runs after the document is fully loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON Usage in This Script\n",
    "- **Sending Data**: Quotes are converted into a JSON object (`JSON.stringify({ author, quote, date })`) before sending via `POST` or `PUT` requests.\n",
    "- **Receiving Data**: The server response is parsed as JSON (`await response.json()`) to dynamically update the UI.\n",
    "- **API Communication**: The script uses **fetch API** to interact with a backend that processes and stores JSON-formatted quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### API for Quote Management\n",
    "\n",
    "This API handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user quotes.  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. `@userquotes.route('/api/userquotes', methods=['POST'])`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Adds a new quote to the database.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",

    "  - Extracts `author`, `quote`, and `date` fields.\n",
    "  - Returns an error if any required field is missing (`400 Bad Request`).\n",
    "  - Creates a new `Quotes` object and adds it to the database.\n",

    "- **Purpose**: Retrieves all quotes from the database.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Queries all quotes from the `Quotes` table.\n",
    "  - Converts each quote object into a **JSON-compatible dictionary**.\n",
    "  - Uses `jsonify()` to return a **list of dictionaries** with the id, quote, author, and date (`200 OK`).\n",

    "- **Purpose**: Deletes a quote by its ID.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Searches for the quote using `Quotes.query.get(id)`.\n",
    "  - If the quote doesn’t exist, returns a JSON error (`404 Not Found`).\n",
    "  - If found, deletes it from the database and commits changes.\n",

    "## Backend: Database Model and Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend uses **Flask-SQLAlchemy** to define and manage a database table for storing quotes. The `Quotes` class represents a database model, and the `initquotes()` function initializes the table with sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Quotes Model**\n",
    "The `Quotes` class is a database table for storing user quotes. It has the following attributes:\n",
    "- `id`: A unique identifier (Primary Key).\n",
    "- `_author`: The name of the person who said the quote.\n",
    "- `_quote`: The actual quote text.\n",
    "- `_date`: The year the quote was said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also includes methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, making it easy to manage quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Database Initialization with `initquotes()`**\n",
    "The function `initquotes()` ensures that the database is properly set up and pre-populated with quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How It Works**\n",
    "1. Calls `db.create_all()` to **create the `user_quotes` table** if it doesn’t exist.\n",
    "2. Adds **predefined quotes** (e.g., from Albert Einstein, Gandhi).\n",
    "3. Uses `.create()` method to insert them into the database.\n",
    "4. Handles errors like duplicate entries using `IntegrityError`.\n",

    "#### Creative Development\n",
    "\n",
    "The restore() function is designed to efficiently process multiple quotes while avoiding duplicates.\n",
    "Uses logical selection (if-else) and iteration (loops) to manage database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Design\n",
    "- The combination of sequencing, selection, and iteration ensures smooth execution.\n",
    "- The if condition prevents duplicate entries, making the program efficient.\n",

    "#### Data Processing\n",
    "- The loop iterates over a dataset of quotes, making the function scalable.\n",
    "- The selection logic ensures that only necessary updates are made.\n"
