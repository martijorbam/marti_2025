I'm Marti Jorba, I am a junior in DNHS. 🎓  
In the last year, I've played rugby 🏉, lacrosse 🥍, and soccer ⚽.  
This is my 3rd year living in San Diego 🌴, the rest of my life I spent in Sant Cugat, Barcelona, Spain 🇪🇸.  
I like playing music 🎶, I play the guitar 🎸 and the bass 🎸, and I enjoy watching F1 🏎️.
