description: How I worked on this page

The biggest changes I've added to this page are the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/formula1/">Formula 1 page</a> , the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/about/">About page</a> and the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2024/09/04/Learning_HTML_IPYNB_2_.html">HTML page.</a>
In the Formula 1 page I added content, images and I little F1 car that you can move with the arrow keys on your keyboard. I had some trouble adding the f1 car because then it wouldn't let me scroll down the page.
The about page contains some information about me, it took me some time to figure out to to put small images next to each other.
The HTML page contains some content and the button and links that we were assigned, the hardest part was making the button work so that some hidden text would show up when you click it. I've also added several notebooks with the things that the Hacks asked to do, they can be accessed in the blog page. Also added several games that can be easily accessed using one of the buttons above.
